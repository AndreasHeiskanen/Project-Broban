## Implementing new features and working with branches 

Before implementing a new feature, create a new issue with the `feature` label and either `game` or `website` depending
which is appropriate and assign yourself. 

When implementing the feature, create a new _feature branch_ and work on that. 

Whenever you start working on something new, create a new branch and commit to that.

Use the following name conventions:

- `feature/{name}` for new features
- `fix/{name}` for fixing bugs
- `update/{name}` for refactoring or updating code

`{name}` should be replaced with a few words describing of what the branch is about, without the { and }.

When you are done with the feature/fix/update, send a pull request to `master`. Someone else will then review
your code and merge it to `master` if it looks good :)
